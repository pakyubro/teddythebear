see			And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep			"We go anywhere, our minds would take us"			And also you are beautiful without your make-up			And you don’t even need to worry about your weight 'cause			We can all be loved the way that God made us			And time’s the only reason that we could break up			'Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much			Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane			"Or make a mistake, say it again"			Oh Nina			You should go Nina			'Cause I ain’t never coming home			"In a road, won’t you leave me now"			And I’ve been living on the road Nina			And then again you should know Nina			'Cause that’s you and me			"Both in a road, won’t you leave me now"			Now			And every weekend in the winter			You’d be wearing my hood			"With jewels, strings pulled tight"			To keep your face in the cold			Taking day trips to the local			Where we D on the road			'Cause every day when I was a baby			Don’t you speak on the phone			Watching Blue Planet			Creating new habits			And if we were two rabbits			And then you'd vanish			Back to burrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing			"You call me selfish, I don’t understand"			But I can’t help it			I put my trouble for everything			Except my family and friends			But you’ll be in between forever			So I guess we’ll have to take a step back			Overlook the situation			'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications			And I’m not saying we should be taking a break			Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late			So we can either deal with the pain			Or wait to get on the plane			But in the day we’ll have to say it again			Oh Nina			You should go Nina			'Cause I ain’t never coming home			"In a road, won’t you leave me now"			And I’ve been living on the road Nina			And then again you should know Nina			'Cause that’s you and me			"Both in a road, won’t you leave me now"			Now			Love will come and love will go			But you can make it on your own			"Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now"			"People grow, and fall apart"			But you can mend your broken heart			"Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now"			Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)			You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)			"'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)"			"In a road, won’t you leave me now"			"And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)"			And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)			'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)			"Both in a road, won’t you leave me now"			Now			Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)			You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)			"'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)"			"In a road, won’t you leave me now"			"And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)"			And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)			'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)			"Both in a road, won’t you leave me now"			Now			No I don't wanna hate you			Just wish you'd never gone for the man			And waited two weeks at least			Before you let him take you			I stayed true			I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school			He's waiting for the time to move			I knew he had his eyes on you			He's not the right guy for you			Don't hate me cause I write the truth			No I would never lie to you			But it was never fine to lose you			And what a way to find out			It never came from my mouth			You never changed your mind			But you were just afraid to mind out			"But f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it"			I'll make your little secret public its nothing			I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me			Trapped and I'm lacking sleep			Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually			You're practically my family			If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be			But tragically our love just lost the will to live			But would I kill to give it one more shot			I think not			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't want you no			Anymore			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't wanna love you no			Anymore			Recently I tend to zone out			Up in my headphones to Holocene			You promised your body but I'm away so much			I stay more celibate than in a monastery			Im not cut out for life on the road			'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much			"And at the time we'd just go, so sue me"			I guess I'm not the man that you need			Ever since you went to uni			I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack			Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad			But when I broke the industry			That's when I broke your heart			I was supposed to chart and celebrate			But good things are over fast			I know it's hard to deal with and see this			I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features			Then I turn the music off			"And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus"			I never really want to believe this			Got advice from my dad and he			Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need			I guess I'm unaware of it			Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't want you no			Anymore			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't wanna love you no			Anymore			And since you left			I've given up my days off			It's what I need to stay strong			I know you have a day job			But mine is 24/7			I feel like writing a book			I guess I lied in the hook			'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could			The irony is if my career and music didn't exist			In 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid			I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink			And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its			Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill			And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27			I'll die from a thrill			Go down in history as just a wasted talent			Can I face the challenge			Or did I make a mistake erasing			It's only therapy			My thoughts just get ahead of me			Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be			Either way I guess I'm not prepared			But I'll say this			These things happen for a reason and you can't change			Take my apology			I'm sorry for the honesty			But I had to get this off my chest			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't want you no			Anymore			I don't love you baby			I don't need you baby			I don't wanna love you no			Anymore			"No, no, no, no, no"			I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans			Goes to the gym at least six times a week			Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet			And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats			He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached			Owns every single Ministry CD			Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means			"But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me"			"But still, I'm just keepin' it real"			Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'			"I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back"			'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at			Let me remind you of the days when			You used to hold my hand			And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans			"I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn't Superman"			Just a young boy tryin' to be loved			So let me give it to ya			I don't wanna know about your new man			'Cause if it was meant to be			You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to			'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			I don't wanna know about your new man			We'll get there eventually			I know you're missin' all this kind of love			But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			Your new man rents a house in the 'burb			"And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse"			"Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas"			"Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous"			"He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime"			"And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign"			"Says, chune, boy never light up the room"			"But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you"			You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'			"Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'"			"Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym keepin' up with Kylie and Kim"			"In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him"			"Okay, you need to be alone"			"And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone"			"I just thought I would tell you, 'cause oughta know"			You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved			So let me give it to ya			I don't wanna know about your new man			'Cause if it was meant to be			You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to			'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			I don't wanna know about your new man			We'll get there eventually			I know you're missin' all this kind of love			But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			"Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week"			But you act so differently			"When you're with him, I know you're lonely"			Please remember you're still free			To make the choice and leave			"Don't call me up, you need to show me"			I don't wanna know about your new man			'Cause if it was meant to be			You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to			'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			I don't wanna know about your new man			We'll get there eventually			I know you're missin' all this kind of love			But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me			But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about			But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about			I don't wanna know about your new man
